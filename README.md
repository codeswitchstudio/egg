# egg
The Egg project. Three tapsilogs at Lola Adang's, please. A project in memory of Manic Pixie Dreamboy and the Sorcerer of Slack.

Featuring really late breakfasts (simple to complicated) friendships (simple to complicated), tiptoeing around already broken eggshells, cheesy, twee, third world middle class angst in the mid to late 1990's, hardboiled aspirations, fragile lives,  chicken and egg metafiction attempts, scrambled feelings, soft landings and nervous new beginnings.

A work in progress.
